Minibone is a compact, versatile, and misuse-resistant library designed to make incorporating end-to-end encryption in your applications **remarkably simple**. It allows you to store and manage your users' sensitive data while ensuring that only the users themselves can access and decrypt the information ‚Äî helping you minimize the blast radius of breaches, meet compliance requirements, enhance privacy, and build trust.

Building _secure-by-design_ applications is _hard_. Minibone makes it _practical_.

### üèóÔ∏è Background

Minibone is built atop the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API). It's restricted to a _conservative_ suite of symmetric algorithms for quantum resistance and robustness.

Specifically, Minibone uses `AES-GCM-256` for encryption, `HKDF-SHA-256` for key derivation, and `PBKDF2-SHA-256` with 500,000 iterations for password-based key derivation. Minibone also opts to keep its dependencies to the bare minimum to reduce the risk of supply-chain attacks.

### ‚ò¢Ô∏è Threat Model

Minibone is designed to run on a `client` device (e.g., your desktop, mobile, or web-based app), storing data with a `provider` (e.g., a SaaS platform) through a `communication channel` (e.g., HTTPS). In this scenario, Minibone is designed to assure confidentiality and integrity, but not availability [1] or freshness [2], when the `provider` and/or the `communication channel` are compromised.

We assume that the client application and device are not compromised and not otherwise vulnerable to side-channel attacks.

1. A malicious `provider` could selectively delete data they store.
¬† ¬†A compromised `communication channel` could selectively drop messages based on metadata.
2. A malicious `provider` could selectively revert data to earlier versions.
¬† ¬†A compromised `communication channel` could replay messages associated with earlier versions.

### üíæ Installation

Minibone is hosted on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minibone). 
You can add it to your project by running the `npm` command below or an equivalent command in your package manager.

```bash
npm i minibone
```

### üìá Usage

```typescript
import Minibone from 'minibone'

// Define a unique service identifier
const serviceIdentifier: any = 'my-unique-service-identifier'

// Virtual API, communication channel and storage provider
class Backend {
    private userBundles: Map<string, Uint8Array> = new Map()
    private dataBundles: Map<string, Uint8Array> = new Map()

    registerUser = async (uid: string, bundle: Uint8Array): Promise<void> => {this.userBundles.set(uid, bundle)}
    fetchUser = async (uid: string): Promise<Uint8Array> => this.userBundles.get(uid) ?? new Uint8Array()
    putData = async (uid: string, data: Uint8Array): Promise<void> => {this.dataBundles.set(uid, data)}
    fetchData = async (uid: string): Promise<Uint8Array> => this.dataBundles.get(uid) ?? new Uint8Array()
}
const virtualBackend = new Backend();

// Register a user; initialize their minibone instance
const minibone: Minibone = await Minibone.create()

// Encrypt and send the user's minibone to the provider
const userName: any = 'some-unique-user-name'
const payload: Uint8Array = await minibone.save('secure-user-secret', [serviceIdentifier, userName])
await virtualBackend.registerUser(userName, payload)

// Encrypt user data
const data: any = {
    sq6wmgv2zcsrix6t: 'BETWEEN SUBTLE SHADING AND THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT LIES THE NUANCE OF IQLUSION.',
}
const encrypted: Uint8Array = await minibone.encrypt(data)
await virtualBackend.putData(minibone.uid, encrypted)

// Fetch and load the user's minibone. You probably want to guard payload retrieval behind multi-factor authentication in production.
const payload: Uint8Array = await virtualBackend.fetchUser(userName)
const loadedMinibone: Minibone = await Minibone.load(payload, 'secure-user-secret', [serviceIdentifier, userName])

// Decrypt data using the reconstructed minibone
const fetched: Uint8Array = await virtualBackend.fetchData(minibone.uid)
const decryptedData: any = await loadedMinibone.decrypt(fetched)
```

### ‚ö† Caveats

Minibone is designed to be simple to use and difficult to abuse. That said, there are a few important aspects to keep in mind when interfacing with Minibone.

1. It's important for the context vector (the second parameter of `minibone.save` and third parameter of `Minibone.load`) to be _globally_ unique to reduce the risk of key reuse and maximize the marginal cost of [rainbow table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) attacks.
2. When prompting end users for a passphrase or master secret, this secret **must** remain client-side. We recommend using a battle-tested password strength estimator (e.g., [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn)). **User secrets should be deleted immediately after use** to make it just that bit harder for attackers.

### üß© Limitations
Minibone relies _solely_ on symmetric cryptography. While this makes it robust against a number of contemporary and future attacks, it also makes data sharing, assured identity, access control, and real-time collaborative workflows infeasible to implement.

Minibone's enterprise counterpart, [Backbone](https://backbone.dev), was designed from first principles to support complex multi-user, multi-enterprise workflows under total end-to-end encryption with a stricter threat model.
